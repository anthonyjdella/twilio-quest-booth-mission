To complete this challenge, you will need to <strong>obtain a Twilio phone number.</strong> 

You can find the number in two ways, either in <a href="https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming">the Twilio console</a> or in the **Code Editor**.

You can also use a new number by <a href="https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223135247-How-to-Search-for-and-Buy-a-Twilio-Phone-Number-from-Console">buying a Twilio number</a>.

<!-- Once you have secured a phone number, enter it in <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-e164" >E.164 format </a> on the right. The validator will be very picky about this format, so use it exactly! For example, the US phone number "(651) 867-5309" would need to be entered as `+16518675309`. -->
