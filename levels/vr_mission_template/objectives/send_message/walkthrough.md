## What information do I need to send an SMS message?

When making an SMS API request to Twilio, in addition to passing along our authentication credentials, we need to provide at least three parameters:

- **Body:** The actual text of the message we want to send.
- **To:** The phone number you want to send the message to.
- **From:** The Twilio programmable phone number the message will be sent from.

## Check Your Formatting!

Make sure the **To** and **From** numbers are formatted in [E.164](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-e164) i.e. +14328879423 

Also, did you start the numbers with **+1**

## SID

Copy that value and paste it into the hacking interface on the right. Then click the *HACK* button.
