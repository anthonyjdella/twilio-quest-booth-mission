## What information do I need to make a phone call?

When making a Call API request to Twilio, in addition to passing along our authentication credentials, we need to provide at least three parameters:

- **TwiML:** Instructions for the call using Twilio's markup language.
- **To:** The phone number you want to call.
- **From:** The Twilio programmable phone number the call will be sent from.

## What is TwiML?

TwiML is Twilio's markup language (like XML). Here's an example of how you can use TwiML to say something: <Response><Say>Ahoy, hello world!</Say></Response>

## Check Your Formatting!

Make sure the **To** and **From** numbers are formatted in [E.164](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-e164) i.e. +14328879423 

Also, did you start the numbers with **+1**

## SID

Copy that value and paste it into the hacking interface on the right. Then click the *HACK* button.
